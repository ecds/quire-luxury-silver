          The silver objects in the nearby case were selected for examination and treatment by the Parsons Conservation
          Laboratory due to the presence of tarnish. Silver tarnishes when exposed to sulfur-containing gases that are
          present in the atmosphere. The resulting layer of silver sulphide is thin but can darken, making inscriptions
          and designs hard to read. Some of the objects are also mercury gilded. This is a method of gilding that
          adheres a layer of gold to the surface so thinly that tarnish can form on top of it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This tarnish layer can be reduced mechanically with a polishing compound or dissolved chemically. Tarnish
          reduction inevitably removes a miniscule layer of the silver surface; therefore, preventing the recurrence of
          tarnish after polishing is essential to the care of silver. This microclimate case is airtight and holds a
          carbon filter that absorbs sulfur-containing compounds, in addition to other materials that prevent the
          occurrence of corrosion.
        </p>

        <p>
          After examination and treatment, inscriptions were documented and better visualized using Reflectance
          Transformation Imaging. RTI is a computational photographic technique that stitches together many raking light
          photographs to produce an interactive image in which the user can control the position of the light source.
          Click on the image of each object to learn more about treatment considerations, object details, and to
          manipulate the RTI images of the inscriptions.

Roosevelt employed photographers to document the plight of everyday folk in the Great Depression in order to push forward with their New Deal programs. Documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans were prolific frontrunners of these efforts and their extraordinary photographs continue to endure today. Their artistic and documentary mastery and historical importance provide key insight into a monumental turning point in American history.\n","id":0,"length":78,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"/"},{"content":"Dorothea Lange had an extraordinary life and career as a prolific photographer. She worked for Arnold Genthe in his portrait studio in New York and studied photography with Clarence White at Columbia University. In 1918 she began to travel around the world to make her living as a photographer. She found herself stranded in San Francisco, so she opened a photographic studio there. Paul Taylor, who would become her second husband, hired her to document migratory workers in California.\n       Expand Dorothea Lange, Resettlement Administration photographer, in California, 1936.Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division  In 1935 she began to work for the Resettlement Administration, later known as the Farm Security Administration (fig. 1). During this period, she made her most famous image, Human Erosion in California (Migrant Mother), of Native American Florence Owens Thompson and her children in a pea-pickers' camp. Other less famous subjects included Japanese internment camps and scenes of workers in factories during World War II. Lange became the first woman awarded a Guggenheim fellowship, and she spent nearly ten years making photo essays for Life and other magazines. She also traveled extensively, making photo essays in Vietnam, Ireland, Pakistan, India, and elsewhere.\n       Expand   Walker Evans began to photograph in the late 1920s, making snapshots during a European trip. Upon his return to New York, he published his first images in 1930. During the Great Depression, Evans began to photograph for the Resettlement Administration, later known as the Farm Security Administration (FSA), documenting workers and architecture in the Southeastern states (fig. 2). In 1936 he traveled with the writer James Agee to illustrate an article on tenant farm families for Fortune magazine; the book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men came out of this collaboration.\nThroughout his career Evans contributed photographs to numerous publications, including three devoted solely to his work. In 1965 he left Fortune, where he had been a staff photographer for twenty years, to become a professor of photography and graphic design at Yale University. He remained in the position until 1974, a year before his death.\n       Expand   ","id":1,"length":344,"title":"Introduction: A Tale of Two Photographers","type":"splash","url":"/intro/"},{"content":"When Evans was officially hired in October 1935 as an Information Specialist by the Historical Section of the Resettlement Administration, his duties were described as follows: \u0026ldquo;Under the general supervision of the Chief of the Historical Section with wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgement and decision as Senior Information Specialist to carry out special assignments in the field; collect, compile and create photographic material to illustrate factual and interpretive news releases and other informational material upon all problems, progress and activities of the Resettlement Administration.\u0026quot;1 Evans was to make liberal use of his right to exercise \u0026ldquo;independent judgement\u0026rdquo; during his time with the RA, and he perpetually resisted the idea that his purpose there was to gather illustrations for the promotion of the RA\u0026rsquo;s (that is, the federal government\u0026rsquo;s New Deal) programs. While considering a position with the RA in the spring of 1935, he jotted down those things he would require of his employer, including the \u0026ldquo;guarantee of one-man performance,\u0026rdquo; and what he would provide, adding that he should not be asked to do anything more in the way of political propaganda: \u0026ldquo;[I] Mean never [to] make photographic statements for the government or do photographic chores for gov or anyone in gov, no matter how powerful—this is pure record not propaganda. The value and, if you like, even the propaganda value for the government lies in the record itself which in the long run will prove an intelligent and farsighted thing to have done. NO POLITICS whatever.\u0026rdquo; (Evans 1938Citation: Evans, Walker. American Photographs. New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1938.)\n       Expand   Because his pictures had been issued by the agency with policy-approved captions for the past three years, Evans felt the need in 1938 to distance himself from that establishment, as well as the world of commercial publishing, by prefacing American Photographs with this statement: \u0026ldquo;The responsibility for the selection of the pictures used in this book has rested with the author, and the choice has been determined by his opinion: therefore they are presented without sponsorship or connection with the policies, aesthetic or political, of any of the institutions, publications or government agencies for which some of the work has been done.\u0026quot;2 Stryker\u0026rsquo;s business was to provide informative images to the mass media, and he and Evans would always disagree about the most appropriate vehicle for the latter\u0026rsquo;s photographs, as well as the definition of \u0026ldquo;documentary.\u0026rdquo; But when the photography project of the RA began, the two men were able to agree on its primary subject: American history as exemplified by life in the average American town. Evans\u0026rsquo;s vision for documenting American life had begun to form much earlier; a letter drafted to his friend Ernestine Evans, an editor at J. B. Lippincott, in February of 1934, makes clear his aspirations:\n What do I want to do? \u0026hellip; I know now is the time for picture books. An American city is the best, Pittsburgh better than Washington. I know more about such a place. I would want to visit several besides Pittsburgh before deciding. Something perhaps smaller. Toledo, Ohio, maybe. Then I’m not sure a book of photos should be identified locally. American city is what I\u0026rsquo;m after\u0026hellip;. People, all classes, surrounded by bunches of the new down-and-out. Automobiles and the automobile landscape. Architecture, American urban taste, commerce, small scale, large scale, the city street atmosphere, the street smell, the hateful stuff, women\u0026rsquo;s clubs, fake culture, bad education, religion in decay\u0026hellip;.3\n The two men could find common ground in part due to the widespread influence of the 1929 publication Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture by Robert and Helen Lynd, professors of sociology at Columbia and Sarah Lawrence, respectively. A 550-page field investigation by social anthropologists with subject headings including \u0026ldquo;What Middletown does to get its living\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The houses in which Middletown lives,\u0026rdquo; this pioneering project attempted an objective analysis of life in a small Midwestern American city (Muncie, Indiana). The Lynds' study was hailed as a very accessible report that was most appealing because it made \u0026ldquo;no attempt to prove anything\u0026rdquo; but simply recorded \u0026ldquo;what was observed.\u0026rdquo; The Lynds introduced their topic by saying their goal \u0026ldquo;was to study synchronously the interwoven trends that are the life of a small American city. A typical city, strictly speaking, does not exist, but the city studied was selected a shaving many features in common to a wide group of communities.\u0026rdquo; (Lynd 1929, 3Citation: Lynd, Robert S., and Helen Merrell Lynd. Middletown: A Study in American Culture San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1929; reprint, Harvest/HBJ, 1956.)\n       Expand   The \u0026ldquo;Outline Memorandum\u0026rdquo; that Evans prepared in October 1935, probably at Stryker\u0026rsquo;s request, laying out plans for an eight-week automobile trip through the Southeast, makes reference to Middletown and presents thoughts similar to the photographer\u0026rsquo;s musings of 1934:\n First objective, Pittsburgh and vicinity, one week; photography, documentary in style, of industrial subjects, emphasis on housing and home life of working-class people\u0026hellip;. Ohio Valley: rural architecture, including the historical, contemporary \u0026ldquo;Middletown\u0026rdquo; subjects; Cincinnati [sic] housing; notes on style of Victorian prosperous period\u0026hellip;. Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois river towns, gather typical documents, main streets, etc., in passing. Ditto Mississippi river towns. Select one of these towns, such as Hannibal, Missouri, for more thorough treatment, if time allows.4\n        Expand   This document goes on to list antebellum plantation architecture in Natchez, Mississippi; small rural French towns in Teche Parish, Louisiana; industrial themes in Birmingham, Alabama; and a cotton plantation in South Carolina, as objectives of the proposed trip for gathering still photography of a \u0026ldquo;general sociological nature.\u0026rdquo; In early 1936, one of Middletown\u0026rsquo;s authors had a chance to directly affect the RA\u0026rsquo;s Photography Section: Stryker showed Robert Lynd, a former Columbia colleague, some RA pictures and asked for his opinion while lunching with him in New York. The result was a \u0026ldquo;shooting script\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;things which should be photographed as American Background,\u0026rdquo; issued by Stryker to his team of photographers. The script contains an extensive listing of items like \u0026ldquo;People on and off the job,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do people look?,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The wall decoration in homes as an index to the different income groups and their reactions,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;A photographic study of use of leisure time in various income groups.\u0026quot;5\n       Expand   Once Evans was officially on staff, his first trip under Stryker\u0026rsquo;s direction seems to have been an extended fall visit to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where steel mills, workers' housing, parading legionnaires, and elaborate gravestones (fig. 1, 2, 3) were his subjects. Between November 1935 and April 1936, Evans made two lengthy road trips that would account for the bulk of his entire production for the RA and many of the 169 mid-thirties pictures that follow this essay. From November to mid-January, here turned to industrial centers in Pennsylvania, finally spending some time in Pittsburgh, and went on to Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, following to some extent the course outlined in the memorandum above. In February 1936, he left again, with a completely Southern itinerary that would take him through many small cities, some of them renowned for ante-bellum architecture and Civil War battles, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, and Virginia.\nIn the spring of 1936, Stryker approved a furlough for Evans to work on a Fortune story with James Agee. This leave for mid-July through mid-September allowed Evans to return to the \u0026ldquo;middle south\u0026rdquo; with Agee to prepare \u0026ldquo;an article on cotton tenantry in the United States, in the form of a photographic and verbal record of the daily lives and environment of an average white family of tenant farmers\u0026rdquo; (fig. 4, 5, 6, 7). (Agee 1941, viiiCitation: Agee, James, and Walker Evans. Let Us Now Praise Famous Men: Three Tenant Families. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1941.) According to the terms of Stryker\u0026rsquo;s arrangement with Fortune\u0026rsquo;s art editor, the pictures Evans produced on this job would become the property of the RA after the magazine had run the finished essay in a fall issue.\n  SHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure-group  One or more of the id values supplied in this shortcode do not match any corresponding id values in your data/figures.yml file. Or, the id values were not fully comma separated.\n{{}}    Once Evans returned from this trip south, during which he and Agee documented the lives of the Burroughs, Fields, and Tengle families in Alabama (see Bud Fields with His Wife and Burrough\u0026rsquo;s Family), he spent September and October printing his pictures and preparing presentations for both Fortune and Stryker.6 Stryker again talked about a New England trip, on which he planned to accompany the photographer, but it did not materialize, and Evans was once more sent to the South, this time to photograph the catastrophe of flooding in Arkansas and Tennessee. An unusual and demanding assignment for Evans, this trip of late January and February 1937 was made with another RA photographer, Edwin Locke, and required that he spend considerable time in the affected area, photographing the flood victims and their temporary shelters.\nThis would be his last travel for the RA, an agency that was absorbed into the Farm Security Administration at about this time. Evans\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the RA\u0026rsquo;s documentation of Depression-era America had essentially been obtained between the summer of 1935 and the spring of 1936, a period of less than a year. The Alabama pictures made while on leave to Fortune would become his best-known photographs and, ironically, those most closely identified with his work as a New Deal photographer.\nThe events generated by the Museum of Modern Art in the fall of 1938 could be viewed as the culmination of a highly productive period made possible by the patronage of the federal government. The sequences of images that appeared in the exhibition and book of American Photo-graphs, though composed of different selections and gleaned from a decade of the photographer\u0026rsquo;s work, might just as appropriately have appeared under the title of \u0026ldquo;Middletown.\u0026rdquo; In fact, Kirstein refers to the Lynds' Middletown in his American Photographs essay, suggesting that, although Evans\u0026rsquo;s work should not be considered merely \u0026ldquo;illustrative accompaniment,\u0026rdquo; a study such as theirs \u0026ldquo;might have been more effective had it also been plotted in visual terms.\u0026rdquo; (Kirstein 1938, 196Citation: Kirstein, Lincoln. Photographs of America: Walker Evans American Photographs. New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1938) An article by Anthony Westen titled \u0026ldquo;Middletown and Main Street,\u0026rdquo; one of the most insightful contemporary comments on Evans\u0026rsquo;s subject matter, appeared in Architectural Review to mark the publication of American Photographs. (West 1939, 218-20Citation: West, Anthony. Middletown and Main street. Architectual Review 85. 1939.)\nA closer look at two little-known RA images—one that appeared in both exhibition formats and one that appeared only in the book—provides a glimpse of how much the exhibitions and publication differed and of the way in which Evans went about editing his own work. Appearing almost in the very middle of the New York installation of American Photographs were two 1937 images of Arkansas flood refugees. One of them—a young African American woman asleep under a quilt in a heavy, metal-frame bed—is found in an almost square Getty print bearing an incomplete MoMA loan number. A second image of almost the same size—a person who looks more like an African American man, partially con-sealed behind a boldly patterned makeshift curtain—is also found at the Getty, but this print, apparently of the same vintage, does not possess a loan number or label. Both images have been severely cropped from the original negative.7 Prints of the two images hung as pendants in the New York show between a photograph of a poor Cuban family from 1933 and a picture of the Tengle family in Hale County, Alabama, singing hymns. The installation list for the circulating version of American Photographs calls for these two images to appear together, only this time toward the end of the show, in group XV (of eighteen groupings specified), where they would be part of a larger selection of seven pictures, including three Alabama tenant farmer images, two Cuban pictures of workingmen and women, and views of factories in Louisiana and wooden stores in Mississippi.\n       Expand   For the book, however, Evans chose a vertically oriented print from another negative of the sleeping woman mentioned above. This image (fig. 8), which might seem more invasive than intimate, is even more startling and unorthodox than the first. It presents the weary flood victim at bedside level, awake but nestled under the quilt. Below her on the floor of the old cotton warehouse that is supplying emergency shelter are a few items of clothing and a bedpan. Occurring at almost the exact center of the book—that is, as plate forty-four in a sequence of eighty-seven images—it falls between a van Gogh-like interior entitled Hudson Street Boarding House Detail, New York and a portrait of three working-class neighbors passing the time together in People in Summer, New York State Town. As comparative material from this winter of 1937 Arkansas assignment, three other prints in the Getty collection depict African American women displaced by the flood and huddled in or near a bed due to cold and illness. Like the two images chosen for the MoMA show, these three reflect substantial cropping of the negatives in an effort to close in on a single figure and eliminate the barn like interior of this uncomfortable temporary home.8 Always after portraits of \u0026ldquo;the anonymous people\u0026rdquo; of Middletown, Evans seems to have taken full advantage of the unusual vulnerability of these residents of Forrest City, Arkansas.\nEvans had company on this RA assignment, which must have been one of the hardest emotionally as well as technically of his career. The report submitted to Stryker by his more communicative colleague, Edwin Locke, gives an immediate picture of the conditions the two men found and the way they attempted to record them. It also con-firms Evans\u0026rsquo;s perfectionist nature, his persistent determination to get the right picture, and the reasons why Roy Stryker, like Tom Mabry, valued his work so highly. The handwritten letter on hotel stationery reads in part:\n My God, we are tired tonight! Got up at 6 this morning, worked until 5:30 PM, made the 6:20 PM train back to Memphis, having covered the refugee camps as well as we could without flashes. And now a word about the camps: L White camp (about 2 miles away from Negro camp—we covered this twice on foot with equipment): well run, adequate tent space, good (regular army) food. A detachment of soldiers from Fort Leavenworth are running the outfit along with the CCC\u0026hellip;. The Negro camp: Overcrowded. There are many more negroes than whites affected by flood in this area. Found 11 in one tent. They are not \u0026ldquo;happy-go-lucky\u0026rdquo; about it, but dazed, apathetic, and hopeless. There is a good deal of illness: excruciating coughs, pneumonia and influenza cases laying in a dark cotton warehouse. I shot in there with the Leica, but Walker said it was too dark. He bought photoflashes and shot with the 4x5, but is afraid that the exposures were wrong. He will undoubtedly want to go back\u0026hellip;.9\n Evans and Stryker parted ways, mostly because of the bureaucratic requirements that Stryker adhered to. Working under difficult conditions was certainly not some-thing the photographer shied away from, particularly when he was after the archetypal portrait of \u0026ldquo;Everyman\u0026rdquo; that he treasured. In pursuit of this goal, for his next major series Evans would contrive to photograph only by remote shutter release while riding the New York subway in winter.\nNotes    Memorandum draft by Walker Evans, reproduced in Walker Evans at Work, (New York: Harper and Row, 1982), 112. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Walker Evans to Ernestine Evans, unfinished two-page letter in black ink on hotel stationery, dated Feb. 1934, first published in Walker Evans at Work, 98.

Silver tarnishes when exposed to sulfur-containing gases that are present in the atmosphere. The resulting layer of silver sulfide is thin but can darken, making inscriptions and designs hard to read. Some of the objects are also mercury gilded. This is a method of gilding that adheres a layer of gold to the surface so thinly that tarnish can form on top of it. This tarnish layer can be reduced mechanically with a polishing compound or dissolved chemically. Tarnish reduction inevitably removes a microns-thick layer of the silver surface; therefore, preventing the recurrence of tarnish after polishing is essential to the care of silver. This airtight microclimate case is specially designed to prevent the occurrence of tarnish. It includes a carbon filter that absorbs sulfur-containing compounds as well as desiccant to lower humidity. After examination and treatment, inscriptions were better visualized and documented using Reflectance Transformation Imaging. RTI is a computational photographic technique that stitches together many raking light photographs to produce an interactive image in which the user can control the position of the light source.

This example has been raised from a single sheet of silver and is decorated on the interior with a turned rim. Versions made from silver such as this represented costly luxuries and would have been used at elite banquets as a form of status display. Some were then buried in tombs or dedicated in temples. The before treatment image of the cup is an excellent example of the wide array of interference colors silver sulfide can produce – blue, yellow, purple, green. Because of this obscuring dark layer, the object was carefully examined under the microscope prior to treatment to ensure there was no mercury gilding present. Mechanical reduction with a polishing compound is only appropriate for objects with robust surfaces that can handle such a treatment, and is therefore not appropriate for thin, damaged mercury gilded surfaces. This object has multiple inscriptions in Greek script, including the name, “SOSYLOU” (“Of Sosylos”), and a number, “ND” (“54 [drachmas]”). Inscribed silver is rare, but a few examples of similar vessels with comparable inscriptions survive from Hellenized Near Eastern kingdoms. The first inscription gives the name of the presumed owner, Sosylos. The second numerical inscription gives the cup’s weight in units of currency, 54 drachmas. This indicates that the cup was weighed using the Parthian weight standard, implying a Near Eastern context. In the RTI image, you can see the guidelines that were scratched into the surface before the final punching of the owner’s name.\n ","id":5,"length":277,"title":"Cat. 2. Pea Pickers, Nipomo, California","type":"entry","url":"/catalogue/2/"},{"content":"Ornately decorated silver drinking vessels, typically made in pairs, were highly prized luxuries in Roman antiquity, and would have been used at elite banquets to display the owner’s wealth and status. Roman authors such as Vergil and Petronius note that these cups also prompted diners to demonstrate their cultured education by discussing the mythological and philosophical imagery that decorated them. This double-walled cup has repoussé and chased decoration on the exterior with an undecorated inner liner. Repoussé and chasing are techniques used together for shaping metal, where the sheet is hammered on the back to create a design (repoussé) and then worked on the front to further define the shape (chasing). This cup is decorated with spiraling acanthus tendrils interspersed with birds. These motifs are typical of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods and evoke a world of natural abundance and prosperity that helped create an atmosphere of luxurious leisure-time for its wealthy viewer. The cup was lightly, selectively polished under magnification. While polishing, remnants of mercury gilding were observed on areas of raised decoration. Age, archaeological context, and previous campaigns of cleaning have caused the gilded surface to abrade away over time. This object has two inscriptions in Greek script. The owner’s name, Menekrates, is lightly scratched into the surface, making it a great candidate for surface enhancement with RTI. While cleaning under the microscope, another inscription was found: a letter that was likely used to mark the position of one of these now-lost vertical ring handles with horizontal thumb-rests The granular surface obscuring the upper half of the letter is likely a weld spot that was used to join the handles to the body of the cup.\n ","id":6,"length":278,"title":"Cat. 3. Bud Fields with His Wife Ivy, and His Daughter Ellen, Hale County, Alabama","type":"entry","url":"/catalogue/3/"},{"content":"This object may be a decorative attachment for the shaft of a ceremonial scepter or perhaps a military standard. The exterior is decorated with six separately cast busts: three facing lion heads terminating in acanthus foliage, alternating with three facing busts of celestial deities. First, the moon goddess Luna wearing a chiton and veil over her shoulder, with her hair pulled back and a crescent moon above her brow. Next, a bearded and veiled Saturn. The head of the third bust is missing, but may represent Sol. He wears a cloak (chlamys) fastened at his shoulder. The imagery implies a connection to the cult of Mithras, an eastern religion that quickly spread across the Roman Empire in part due to its popularity with soldiers, attracted by the promise of life after death. The entire outer surface of the collar is mercury gilded. To mercury gild a metal object, the craftsman first makes an amalgam of gold and mercury and paints it onto the surface of the object. The object is then fired at a relatively low temperature, below the melting point of the silver, which drives a great deal of the mercury away and bonds the gold to the metal below. This layer of gold is incredibly thin, about 2 – 20 microns, and can contain 8-25% mercury. Because this layer is so thin, tarnish of the silver below can form on top of the gilding. The same chemical compound used to reduce tarnish on the Sasanian bowl was used on the surface of the collar. This chemical compound is a toxic carcinogen, so personal protection like gloves, a respirator, and protective were necessary.\n ","id":7,"length":274,"title":"Cat. 4. Decorative Collar with Busts of Celestial Deities","type":"entry","url":"/catalogue/4/"},{"content":"Silver bowls of this type, with a narrow, elliptical shape and ring foot, are characteristic of Sasanian production during the sixth and seventh centuries CE and were likely made in workshops connected to the Sasanian royal court. Silver was a highly valued commodity, due in part to a lack of abundant sources within the Sasanian empire. Such vessels were used at lavish banquets and were given as royal gifts, signaling wealth and prestige. This bowl was made more impressive by the addition of mercury gilding to accentuate the figures engraved on its exterior surface. The decoration itself recalls Dionysian motifs seen throughout earlier Greek and Roman art, especially on drinking vessels, and evokes an atmosphere of abundance and pleasure: scrolling vines loaded with grape clusters and vine leaves are interspersed with bird’s nests, and birds, foxes, and hares play between the tendrils. The survival of Dionysian imagery in Sasanian art, as well as the adoption and adaptation of metalworking techniques, attests to the intercultural connections that existed between the Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian empires in Late Antiquity. In the before treatment image, it is clear how tarnish can obscure the luxurious materiality of mercury gilded silver. The gilded surface is damaged from a combination of its age, archaeological context, and previous campaigns of cleaning. A chemical compound suspended in a gel system was used to dissolve the silver sulfide. This gel allowed for a controlled application of the compound at the surface of the gilding. A Middle Persian inscription was punched on the underside of the vessel within the ring foot, and gives the male name \u0026ldquo;Ohrmazd\u0026rdquo;. The elemental composition of the foot was analyzed with portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy; it was found to contain a significantly higher amount of copper than the bowl. The difference in alloy composition may suggest that the foot was added at a later date.\n ","id":8,"length":310,"title":"Cat. 5.

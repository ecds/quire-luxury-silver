The silver objects in the nearby case were selected for examination and treatment by the Parsons Conservation Laboratory due to the presence of tarnish.  Silver tarnishes when exposed to sulfur-containing gases that are present in the atmosphere. The resulting layer of silver sulfide is thin but can darken, making inscriptions and designs hard to read. Some of the objects are also mercury gilded. This is a method of gilding that adheres a layer of gold to the surface so thinly that tarnish can form on top of it.

This tarnish layer can be reduced mechanically with a polishing compound or dissolved chemically. Tarnish reduction inevitably removes a microns-thick layer of the silver surface; therefore, preventing the recurrence of tarnish after polishing is essential to the care of silver. This airtight microclimate case is specially designed to prevent the occurrence of tarnish.  It includes a carbon filter that absorbs sulfur-containing compounds as well as desiccant to lower humidity.

After examination and treatment, inscriptions were visualized and documented using Reflectance Transformation Imaging. RTI is a computational photographic technique that stitches together many raking light photographs to produce an interactive image in which the user can control the position of the light source. Select an object from the menu to learn more about treatment considerations, object details, and to manipulate the RTI images of the inscriptions.

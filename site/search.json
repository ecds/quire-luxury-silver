This example has been raised from a single sheet of silver and is decorated on the interior with a turned rim. Versions made from silver such as this represented costly luxuries and would have been used at elite banquets as a form of status display. Some were then buried in tombs or dedicated in temples.\nThe before treatment image of the cup is an excellent example of the wide array of interference colors silver sulfide can produce \u0026ndash; blue, yellow, purple, green. Because of this obscuring dark layer, the object was carefully examined under the microscope prior to treatment to ensure there was no mercury gilding present. Mechanical reduction with a polishing compound is only appropriate for objects with robust surfaces that can handle such a treatment, and is therefore not appropriate for thin, damaged mercury-gilded surfaces.\nThis object has multiple inscriptions in Greek script, including the name, \u0026ldquo;SOSYLOU\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Of Sosylos\u0026rdquo;), and a number, \u0026ldquo;ND\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;54 [drachmas]\u0026quot;). Inscribed silver is rare, but a few examples of similar vessels with comparable inscriptions survive from Hellenized Near Eastern kingdoms. The first inscription gives the name of the presumed owner, Sosylos. The second numerical inscription gives the cup\u0026rsquo;s weight in units of currency, 54 drachmas. This indicates that the cup was weighed using the Parthian weight standard, implying a Near Eastern context. In the RTI image, the guidelines that were scratched into the surface before the final punching of the owner\u0026rsquo;s name are visible.\n ","id":1,"length":275,"title":"Exhibit 1.

Roman authors such as Vergil and Petronius note that these cups also prompted diners to demonstrate their cultured education by discussing the mythological and philosophical imagery that decorated them.\nThis double-walled cup has repoussé and chased decoration on the exterior with an undecorated inner liner. Repoussé and chasing are techniques used together for shaping metal, where the sheet is hammered on the back to create a design (repoussé) and then worked on the front to further define the shape (chasing). This cup is decorated with spiraling acanthus tendrils interspersed with birds. These motifs are typical of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods and evoke a world of natural abundance and prosperity that helped create an atmosphere of luxurious leisure-time for its wealthy viewer.\nThe cup was lightly, selectively polished under magnification. While polishing, remnants of mercury gilding were observed on areas of raised decoration. Age, archaeological context, and previous campaigns of cleaning have caused the gilded surface to abrade away over time.\nThis object has two inscriptions in Greek script. The owner\u0026rsquo;s name, Menekrates, is lightly scratched into the surface, making it an ideal candidate for surface enhancement with RTI. While cleaning under the microscope, another inscription was found: a letter that was likely used to mark the position of one of the now-lost vertical ring handles with horizontal thumb-rests. The granular surface obscuring the upper half of the letter is likely a weld spot that was used to join the handles to the body of the cup.\n ","id":2,"length":278,"title":"Exhibit 2. Drinking Cup (Skyphos)","type":"entry","url":"/case-1/2/"},{"content":"This object may be a decorative attachment for the shaft of a ceremonial scepter or perhaps a military standard. The exterior is decorated with six separately cast busts: three facing lion heads terminating in acanthus foliage, alternating with three facing busts of celestial deities. First, the moon goddess Luna wearing a chiton and veil over her shoulder, with her hair pulled back and a crescent moon above her brow. Next, a bearded and veiled Saturn. The head of the third bust is missing, but may represent Sol. He wears a cloak (chlamys) fastened at his shoulder. The imagery implies a connection to the cult of Mithras, an eastern religion that quickly spread across the Roman Empire in part due to its popularity with soldiers attracted by the promise of life after death.\nThe entire outer surface of the collar is mercury gilded. To mercury gild a metal object, the craftsman first makes an amalgam of gold and mercury and paints it onto the surface of the object. The object is then fired at a relatively low temperature, below the melting point of the silver, which drives a great deal of the mercury away and bonds the gold to the metal below. This layer of gold is incredibly thin, about 2\u0026ndash;20 microns, and can contain 8-25% mercury. Because this layer is so thin, tarnish of the silver below can form on top of the gilding.\nA chemical compound suspended in a gel system was used to dissolve the silver sulfide. This gel allowed for a controlled application of the compound at the surface of the gilding.\nThis chemical compound is a toxic carcinogen, so personal protection like gloves, a respirator, and protective goggles were necessary.\n ","id":3,"length":284,"title":"Exhibit 3. Decorative Collar with Busts of Celestial Deities","type":"entry","url":"/case-1/3/"},{"content":"Silver bowls of this type, with a narrow, elliptical shape and ring foot, are characteristic of Sasanian production during the sixth and seventh centuries CE and were likely made in workshops connected to the Sasanian royal court. Silver was a highly valued commodity, due in part to a lack of abundant sources within the Sasanian empire. Such vessels were used at lavish banquets and were given as royal gifts, signaling wealth and prestige.\nThis bowl was made more impressive by the addition of mercury gilding to accentuate the figures engraved on its exterior surface. The decoration itself recalls Dionysian motifs seen throughout earlier Greek and Roman art, especially on drinking vessels, and evokes an atmosphere of abundance and pleasure: scrolling vines loaded with grape clusters and vine leaves are interspersed with bird\u0026rsquo;s nests, and birds, foxes, and hares play between the tendrils. The survival of Dionysian imagery in Sasanian art, as well as the adoption and adaptation of metalworking techniques, attests to the intercultural connections that existed between the Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian empires in Late Antiquity.\nIn the before treatment image, it is clear how tarnish can obscure the luxurious materiality of mercury gilded silver. The gilded surface is damaged from a combination of its age, archaeological context, and previous campaigns of cleaning. A chemical compound suspended in a gel system was used to dissolve the silver sulfide. This gel allowed for a controlled application of the compound at the surface of the gilding.\nA Middle Persian inscription was punched on the underside of the vessel within the ring foot, and gives the male name \u0026quot;Ohrmazd.\u0026quot; The elemental composition of the foot was analyzed with portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy; it was found to contain a significantly higher amount of copper than the bowl. The difference in alloy composition may suggest that the foot was added at a later date.\n ","id":4,"length":310,"title":"Exhibit 4.
